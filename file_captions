by tringacodes Back to work from today ! I'm a dilemma whether i should start exploring another frontend framework (maybe vuejs, sounds interesting ) or start improving my DS and algorithm skills... 

What do you think it's most important for a full stack dev? 

Have a great week 

Picked for using #thedevlife

 When stuck, step away.

I was working on a PHP with MySQL project and I got stuck. I spent hours trying to make it work but nothing seemed to solve it. I was getting really frustrated. 

Started doubting myself, my skills and capabilities. 

I decided then to take a look at some other projects and studying different subjects, ate something, drank some coffee and then, when I looked at it with fresh eyes, I literally solved in 2 minutes. 

 Doubting yourself is normal. Letting it stop you is a choice.

Guess the programming language  (and Ill like all your pictures) 
-
-
Yes youve heard right! 
-
Ill all pictures in 24h of the first 10 persons who guess the programming has language right

A pic of a REAL programmer (as you can tell from the Club Mate).
.
.
Have a look at an excerpt from the list of bullshit I heard in my (programming) life:
Real programmers use vim and not PyCharm. Real programmers are experts in at least 10 programming languages and html is NOT one of them. Real programmers use linux (from scratch of course). Real programmers studied CS. Real programmers can write a compiler while juggling 5 Club Mate bottles and riding a burning bicycle whistling the Free Software song (backwards).
.
.
Okay, I haven't heard the last sentence before but it's about as absurd as the others  
.
.
I'm not a psychologist so I'm not sure what leads to this gatekeeping, elitist nonsense. Insecurities? Arrogance? The thought "I had to suffer to become a programmer so everyone else has to suffer, too"? The fear of not being special? 
Maybe all of it. I don't know.
.
.
What I do know however is that it keeps people from learning to code, especially marginalized people. That it makes it unnecessarily hard to get into tech. That it creates a toxic environment where learning and progress are difficult or even impossible.
.
.
So to make this clear: you are a real programmer no matter what programming language you use or learn. Or how many languages you know. No matter if you're self-taught or have a degree in CS. No matter what editor or IDE you use, no matter what OS, no matter what color your socks have. 
.
.
Have you heard one of those "definitions" of a "real" programmer, too? What are your thoughts?

Happy Thursday 

I am currently recording a crash course for you - "How To Build Amazon Gallery Full Stack App with Django Rest Framework API" 
It requires from my side a lot of commitment but I really enjoy it. Also, I am currently busy with finding clients for selfmade.software . More info soon, I promise. Stay tuned.

Please tell me what are you currently working on?  Have a great day and stay healthy friends!

Finished off ! Hurray! Just client needs to approve it! Fingers crossed!
.
What a two months! It was well worth it! I love this feeling when everything is done and works nicely and when I am proud that my new baby code is going to the world helping others!

Have a good Thursday everyone!

Know when to stop

I know that my biggest obstacle is beating procrastination. So to overcome that I usually do to-do lists and time schedules. Which works brilliantly until I over do it. 

When I plan everything down to the minute and set exact time frames for how long I need to code. The fun runs out very quickly. Information goes in one ear and out the next. 

When I notice this I make myself stop and take a break. Theres no point in learning when its all about how much time I put in and not about the knowledge. 

Do you ever struggle with this? Can you work through it or do you take breaks?

by justinbieshaar "It's not about making the right choice.
It's abo    ut making a choice and making it right."

I truely believe in things happening for a reason. Things happen for a reason because of your decision and making the best out of it. No matter if it is a choice to let something go or to choose to take action. As long as you make a decision and try to make most of it, good things will always happen.

I never met someone who's upcomming 2 year plan came completely true. We always face decisions and struggles causing to change directions. But there's always a bright end making it have happened for a reason. 
I never expected to be where I am today and never expected to grow as much as I did in past year. But just because I made certain decisions and certain sacrifices, I grew to who I am today.

So can you do too! Do what feels best and believe in your decisions. Because believing is first step in making it right!.

Happy coding everyone!

WHAT IS ANALYSIS PARALYSIS?

 Analysis paralysis occurs when a person or a group process is "paralyzed" by trying to reach consensus, finding "the best" solution or just overthinking the situation.

 Examples from the real world: spending days on reading articles with comparisons and opinions in order to choose "the best" framework, instead of just choosing the one you know well and is good enough for the task. This way, you could have saved a lot of time.

Have you ever been paralyzed by analysis?

Happy Thursday!

Do you prefer silence or noise

For me it depends, if Im learning something new I like silence, I put my earplugs even if its relatively quiet space to concentrate better 

But other times I like something to be played in the background, like tv or music etc 
So I had a chance to play around with the new #RazerBlade15 Base edition in the past couple of days  Since I also had the last years model at hand, I wanted to do a side by side comparison.


While therere some considerable spec bumps in this years model, I think both of these machines are equally powerful and can easily fit into my workflow without an issue 


The most striking changes to me however; were related mostly to the User Experience  First of all, they changed out the keyboard layout to fit in a larger Right Shift key instead of the custom sized smaller one they had. And honestly, I didnt know how much I needed the Right Shift until I started messing up on that old layout 


I might be wrong on this, but I think the internal cooling system is changed as well. On the last years model the fans would kick in from under the keyboard, which gave me a weird feeling while typing/gaming. On the 2020 model, I havent had that issue, even though I can hear the fans kicking off 


All-in-all, Im getting more and more impressed with the Razer line-up. I sadly have to say goodbye to this unit, as it was a loaner for the review. But Im seriously considering getting the Advanced model as a personal laptop  (PS: It has an SD-Card Slot )

 Lets talk about the benefits of working for a smaller team (even if it part of a bigger company like mine)! My Paint 3D and Cortana in Windows team is based in London, but we have always fed into a bigger team based in Microsoft HQ in the USA. When I chose to work for my London team and not Xbox in Seattle after I graduated.

AirPods Pro are back from repair. Actually, that is a brand new pair, repair for them is just replacement, seems that they are not repairable at all.
I tested AirPods Pro VS Sony MX4 side by side while kids were watching TV difference. Results could be different between testers, AirPods Pro doesn't fit perfectly in my ears, but for me, that is day and night.
Sony with noise canceling on and some music playing remove any background noise completely, trough AirPods Pro I'm still can hear my kids, dishwasher or Roomba moving around.
Sure I'm glad to get AirPods back from the service center, but Sony MX4 will stay my daily driver. AirPods will be for running around and podcast listening, Sony for daily work because of better sound isolation and neverending battery life.
I have no idea yet what I will do when traveling will be back to normal and I should choose one of them to pack for the trip.
